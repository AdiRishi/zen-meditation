## What's included

- **Tailwind CSS v4** via [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/) — utility-first styling that works on native and web
- **[HeroUI Native](https://v3.heroui.com/docs/native/getting-started)** — polished component library with buttons, inputs, accordions, and more
- **Dark mode** — full light/dark theming via CSS variables, one file to customize
- **Expo Router** — file-based routing with typed routes and native tab navigation
- **[TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form)** — composable, type-safe forms via `createFormHook` with Zod validation
- **[Nitro](https://nitro.build/) + [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)** — type-safe API server in a monorepo, deployable to Cloudflare Workers
- **React 19 + React Compiler** — latest React with automatic optimizations
- **Strict TypeScript, Expo ESLint, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Turborepo** — opinionated DX with import and Tailwind class sorting
- **Jest + React Native Testing Library + Vitest** — frontend and server unit tests with app providers and tRPC test helpers
- **Agent skills** — context-aware guidance for HeroUI Native, React correctness, and reusable composition patterns
- **Codex harness instructions** — local iOS simulator validation through the Browser Use plugin

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version pinned in `.node-version`
- pnpm pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json`
- Xcode (for iOS simulator) and/or Android Studio (for Android emulator)

## Quick start

**1. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

**2. Start the API server:**

```bash
pnpm run server:dev   # Nitro dev server on localhost:3000
```

**3. Build and run** (in a separate terminal):

```bash
pnpm run prebuild     # Regenerate native projects when needed
pnpm ios              # Compile packages, then run the iOS simulator
pnpm android          # Compile packages, then run the Android emulator
pnpm web              # Compile packages, then start Expo web
```

Root scripts are the public interface for everyday work. They compile internal packages first, then delegate to the app or server workspace.

## Development scripts

```bash
pnpm run compile        # Compile shared internal packages
pnpm run lint           # App + server/shared package lint
pnpm run lint:app       # Expo ESLint for the mobile app
pnpm run lint:server    # Oxlint for the API and shared packages
pnpm run typecheck      # TypeScript across all workspaces
pnpm run format         # Oxfmt write
pnpm run format:check   # Oxfmt check
pnpm run check          # Lint + format check + typecheck
```

Native projects and task outputs are generated and ignored. `apps/mobile/ios/`, `apps/mobile/android/`, `.expo/`, `.turbo/`, `coverage/`, and package `dist/` folders can be deleted and regenerated from scripts.

## Testing

Frontend unit tests run with Jest and React Native Testing Library. Server unit tests run with Vitest.

```bash
pnpm run test           # app + server tests
pnpm run test:app       # app tests only
pnpm run test:server    # server tests only
```

App tests live in `apps/mobile/tests/` and mirror `apps/mobile/src/` paths, with shared helpers in `apps/mobile/tests/testing-utils/`. Use small scenario-explicit builders for repeated data shapes, and keep feature-specific mocks in the test or harness that needs them. Server tests live under `servers/api/tests/` and mirror backend paths.

## Agent validation

This repository includes a Codex harness for validating native changes end-to-end. Agents can launch the app, drive the iOS simulator through the Browser Use plugin, verify the result, run checks, and clean up.
